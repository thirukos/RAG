# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This project implements a local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model based on the novel "One Hundred Years of Solitude." The model uses the `sentence_transformers` model `all-mpnet-base-v2` for embedding and Google's open-source `google/gemma-2b-it` and `google/flan-t5-large` language models for text generation.
